# Daily-Planner
Python program for building and saving simple daily planners

**Creating Planners:**
When creating a planner you will be prompted to input how many days from today's date the intended planner date is.
This input should be a single integer. To create a planner for today's date simply input 0.

When creating an event for a planner there are two prompts:

1. The first prompt is the name of the event. This can be any string.

2. The second prompt is the time the event will take place.
   The time should be input in 24-hour time (HH:MM)

To stop adding events simply input 'exit'

New planners will be saved as simple text files to the working directory of the program file.

**Loading Planners:**
Loading a planner will display the desired planner in the console window.

When loading a planner it will prompt for the date of the desired planner.
The date should be input as 'Day Month Year' Where the day and month are written in full.
